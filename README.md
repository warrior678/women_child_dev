# Women & Child Development Analytics 🇮🇳

This project analyzes publicly available datasets from the Ministry of Women & Child Development (MoWCD), focusing on health, education, and budget indicators across Indian states. It aims to uncover trends, disparities, and underutilization of schemes to inform data-driven policy decisions.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Explore malnutrition, maternal/child mortality, and education enrollment trends
- Assess budget allocation vs. scheme utilization
- Identify states with critical gaps in health and education outcomes

---

## 📂 Datasets Used
- Anaemia prevalence among women and children
- Malnutrition by state and year
- Maternal & infant mortality rates (global and national)
- Education gross enrollment ratios
- Budget allocation and scheme underutilization
- Anganwadi honorarium and state-wise enrollment

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and trend analysis

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- States with high malnutrition often show low scheme utilization
- Budget allocation does not always correlate with improved outcomes
- Education enrollment disparities persist across regions

---

## 📁 Output Files
- `cleaned_combined_output.csv`: Unified dataset for analysis
- Visualizations (to be added)
- Summary report (in progress)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
- Integrate prompt-powered insights for policy simulation
- Document findings for public health stakeholders

---

## 🤝 Contributions
Open to collaboration on dashboarding, policy modeling, and regional deep-dives.
